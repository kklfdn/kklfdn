                        <p>
                            <span class="bold-text">As a life-long learner,</span> Karlson has long been a man of integrity and passion. While an undergraduate student at UBC, he helped exposed an underground essay mill. He wrote his graduate thesis on authoritarian land use policy and expropriation. Yet in law school, he found himself asking: &ldquo;How could this have happened?&rdquo; While at times he regretted his vocational choice, his passion and energy inspired him to focus his efforts on making law school a positive place for everyone.
                        </p>
                          <p>
                              The King is copiously educated. Among his numerous credentials, he holds a Certificate in Transnational Law from the University of Geneva and a Certificate in British Politics and Policymaking from the London School of Economics.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                              On his journey as a student, Karlson found that learning was enhanced through experiential education and extracurricular opportunities. He served as Vice President of the UBC Fencing Club. Fencing was a fantastic opportunity for him to develop hand-eye coordination, while serving on the executive bolstered his confidence and leadership skills. At Oxford, he was on the executive of the Clay Pigeon Shooting Club and the Oxford Union: here he learned how to responsibly handle firearms and sidestep questions that he did not want to answer.

                      <h2>Wanderer</h2>
                      <p>
                          <span class="bold-text">King&rsquo;s passion for the public good has led him around the world,</span> talking to and interacting with scores of average people. Through his time at the UN Development Programme in Beijing, as an intern at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and as a Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts, he became a truly global citizen. Yet, he remains deeply rooted to U of T Law, most notably lending his transnational expertise as contributor to and now Editor in Chief of <em>Rights Review</em>. His passion for human rights led to his executive role with the Canadian Bar Association&rsquo;s Constitutional and Human Rights Section, where he works to promote the understanding of these sophisticated legal issues.

                      </div>
                      <p>
                         Unafraid of danger or civil unrest, Karlson often seeks out some of the most volatile regions of the Earth. Whether it be on the streets of Hong Kong during the Umbrella Revolution or the streets of Barcelona during the Catalonian independence movement, whereever there is an international news story or photo-op, the King finds a way to slip in.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          Being a wanderer is not without its risks. King has watched his residence catch fire, been robbed by strangers, and gotten himself lost in unknown territories. He has also made his share of cultural faux pas, including walking into a Michelin-star restaurant without a reservation just to order a tea. However, he sees these experiences as learning opportunities to better understand the many differing and unique cultures. As a result of understanding the wide range of cultural norms and values, he has become a symbol of unity for individuals from all walks of life.
                      </p>

                      </div>
                      <p>
                          A believer in food as common ground between people, Karlson maintains a veritable repository of information on the most exquisite restaurants and local delicacies wherever he happens to be. When he was once asked by a professor how he decides what to eat at a new restaurant, the King replied: &ldquo;It all entirely depends. If I cannot decide between two things, I would narrow it down to a group of stuff that I’m interested in eating, like noodles. Then I would go into that category and pick one option from there to reduce decision-making. Or whatever I feel like eating that day. Usually I would go for a dish that I usually like. But I wouldn’t read through the whole menu.&rdquo;

                      <p>
                          Back in Toronto, King shares the novel perspectives on legal doctrine garnered from his transatlantic jaunts by serving as a working group leader with the International Human Rights Program. A tireless advocate, he has billed numerous hours toward his pursuit of global social equity by land, speedboat, and airplane.

                          <span class="bold-text">At a time when many were silent,</span> Karlson took strong, principled positions on issues that mattered to students. After witnessing first-hand the stresses caused by ExamSoft, he felt the importance of ensuring that no student would be left behind. King quickly decried the unreliable software behind these problems, thus playing his part in one of the most effective student-led campaigns in the law school&rsquo;s recent history.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          He has also been a progressive voice on social policy. Karlson has harshly criticized the global financialization of housing. He was quoted in Quartz for his expertise on direct action and protests during Hong Kong&rsquo;s Umbrella Revolution. He has also opined on the significance of pluralism and religious freedom.
                      </p>
